Servicely is an iOS app we worked on for CS 378 iOS Programming at UT Austin. Servicely connects service providers such as carpenters, tutors, mechanics, etc. to clients who seek their services.



## Feed
The Feed view shows a feed of service offers if you're using the app as a client, or a feed of client requests if you're using the app as a service provider.

## Categories
The Categories view shows a list of categories that the app supports. Selecting a category shows the user a list of posts that match that category.
